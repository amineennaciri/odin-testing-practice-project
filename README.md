# odin-testing-practice-project
This is the testing practice project from TOP(the odin project) Full Stack JavaScript course.

This project is about practicing the testing using JEST.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in testing a script of code.

Self-reflection and conclusion: this was an opportunity to practice testing using JEST.
